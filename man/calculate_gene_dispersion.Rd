\arguments{
\item{cds}{the cell_data_set upon which to perform this operation.}

\item{q}{the polynomial degree; default = 3.}

\item{id_tag}{the name of the feature data column corresponding to 
the unique id - typically ENSEMBL id; default = "id".}

the gene symbol; default = "gene_short_name".}

\description{
Monocle3 aims to learn how cells transition through a
biological program of gene expression changes in an experiment. Each cell
can be viewed as a point in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension
describes the expression of a different gene. Identifying the program of
gene expression changes is equivalent to learning a \emph{trajectory} that
the cells follow through this space. However, the more dimensions there are
in the analysis, the harder the trajectory is to learn. Fortunately, many
genes typically co-vary with one another, and so the dimensionality of the
data can be reduced with a wide variety of different algorithms. Monocle3
provides two different algorithms for dimensionality reduction via
\code{reduce_dimensions} (UMAP and tSNE). The function
\code{calculate_dispersion} is an optional step in the trajectory building
process before \code{preprocess_cds}.  After calculating dispersion for
a cell_data_set using the \code{calculate_gene_dispersion} function, the 
\code{select_genes} function allows the user to identify a set of genes
that will be used in downstream dimensionality reduction methods.  These
genes and their disperion and mean expression can be plotted using the 
\code{plot_gene_dispersion} function.
